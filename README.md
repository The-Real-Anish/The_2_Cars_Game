# The_2_Cars_Game

I was familiar with this game for some time, and decided to try and create it myself.
For this project, I am learning about Kotlin and the object-oriented paradigm in detail.

To see my code, go to app -> src -> main
* *res* contains the vector drawables (animated and non-animated) I'm using for cars.
* *cppapp* contains the Kotlin class files (as you can tell, it is a work in progress, although I have somewhat successfully managed to produce some animations)

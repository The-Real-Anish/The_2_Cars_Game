# The_2_Cars_Game

I was familiar with this game for some time, and decided to try and create it myself.
For this project, I am learning about Kotlin and the object-oriented paradigm in detail.

To see my code, go to app -> src -> main
* *res* contains the vector drawables (animated and non-animated) I'm using for cars.
* *cppapp* contains the Kotlin class files. As you can tell, it is a work in progress, although I have successfully produced all individual animations and am close to finishing off the car motions.

This is what the main game screen currently looks like. I ran it on a Pixel 3a API 33 x86 64 Emulator in Android Studio.
